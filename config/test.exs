# Test daemon identity. Resolved at Poller boot via SHUTTLE_HOST → the
# real :inet.gethostname(). We don't pin it here at the Application
# config layer any more — the previous pin (host: "local") leaked into
# escripts built with MIX_ENV=test and stamped "local" onto production
# daemons, then every fiber without an explicit host: silently failed
# the dispatch filter. Setting SHUTTLE_HOST during the test run keeps
# tests stable across machines without writing the value into the
# release artifact. Tests that need to exercise host-pin matching also
# pass explicit `own_host_id:` opts to `Poller.start_link`.
