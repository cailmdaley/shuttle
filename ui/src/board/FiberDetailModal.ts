/**
 * FiberDetailModal — one click on a kanban card opens the fiber itself.
 *
 * A floating, draggable, edge-and-corner-resizable panel whose body is a
 * single-column page: outcome lede, then the markdown body. The standalone
 * UI emulates the vellum look in CSS rather than importing vellum's
 * `NarrativeView`/PretextProse stack — the body is rendered by the lean
 * `marked` renderer (`utils.renderMarkdown`) and styled to read like a
 * vellum page (`.kbn-detail-prose` in FiberDetailModal.css). The markdown
 * comes from the daemon's `GET /api/v1/fibers/<id>?body=true`, which reads the
 * daemon's stores including the git-synced `~/loom` mirror — so remote-host
 * fibers normally render here too; a fiber the local daemon can't read (not
 * synced to its mirror, or bodyless) degrades to its outcome, which the
 * composite feed always carries. `:::{embed}` artifacts and relative images render through the
 * daemon's owner-routed `/file` route, anchored on the fiber's own dir.
 *
 * Every card action lives in one dropdown directly under the title,
 * collapsed by default: directive box + "wait for me", New session /
 * Resume, Temper / Compost, agent / kind / schedule, tags, parent fiber,
 * and the drill-out to the full workspace.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a Radix AppDialog and NOT background-locked: the panel
 * is non-modal by design — "drag it aside to keep an eye on one fiber
 * while working the board" requires the kanban behind it to stay
 * interactive, so there is no scrim, no focus trap, no body-inert. This is
 * the documented exception to the new-modal invariant. Escape still
 * closes; only one instance is open at a time. The root keeps the
 * `.kbn-detail-overlay` class so Camera's wheel-exemption `closest()`
 * list keeps routing wheel events to the panel instead of zooming the map.
 *
 * Lifecycle: `open(card)` mounts the panel; `close()` tears it down
 * (including the React root inside the page pane).
