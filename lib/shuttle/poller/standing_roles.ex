defmodule Shuttle.Poller.StandingRoles do
  @moduledoc """
  The poller-side standing-role lifecycle.

  Standing roles are perennial constitutions with a cron `schedule:` — they
  arm (`status: active`, no verdict), fire when a scheduled occurrence has
  elapsed since they were last serviced, run to `status: closed` awaiting
  review, and re-arm on human accept. This module owns that lifecycle as the
  poller sees it: the catch-up due rule, the awaiting/park transitions on
  worker exit, the daemon-down dead-orphan reconciliation, parsing roles from
  candidate documents, and the display snapshots.

  It is distinct from `Shuttle.StandingRole`, the pure parser/cron module these
  functions read through. State-shaped helpers take the `Shuttle.Poller.State`
  struct and return updated state or values, mirroring the signatures they had
  inside `Shuttle.Poller`. Truly shared helpers (`role_kind/1`,
  `host_for_fiber/2`, `host_owned?/2`, `running_key/2`, `iso_to_unix_ms/1`,
  `fetch_shuttle_block/2`, `dependencies_satisfied?/2`, `list_shuttle_sessions/1`,
  `runtime_key_for_fiber/1`) stay in `Shuttle.Poller` and are called from here.

  # Standing dispatch is gated entirely by the FELT DOCUMENT — not a runtime
  # review overlay and not a stored `next_due_at`.
  # A role dispatches iff its document says `status: active` with no verdict
  # (`tempered` unset) AND the cron schedule fired a tick inside the poll window
  # ending at now. `status: closed` (untempered) is the awaiting-review /
  # don't-re-fire signal — eligible?'s `status == "closed"` clause already
  # excludes it before this is reached, and the `active → closed → active`
  # document transition is the per-cycle "already ran this cycle" gate.
  # The one standing-role dispatch rule: an active role is due when a scheduled
  # occurrence has elapsed since it was last serviced. "Last serviced" is the most
  # recent of — the latest dispatch/handoff marker timestamp (durable across
  # restarts; a human re-arm stamps the handoff marker too), the in-memory re-arm
  # stamp, or the role's creation if it has never run. Expressed against the cron
  # primitive as the lookback `now -
  # last_serviced`: `due_by_cron?` then asks "did a tick fire after the last
  # service, at or before now?" — i.e. is there an unrun occurrence. (A
  # non-positive lookback ⇒ nothing elapsed since service ⇒ not due, handled by
  # `due_by_cron?`'s guard.)
  #
  # This makes the schedule SELF-CATCHING: a fire missed because the daemon was
  # down or the laptop asleep at the cron instant runs on the next poll instead —
  # however late. One catch-up fires, not a backlog: the run writes a fresh
  # dispatch marker, advancing the anchor to ~now, so the next poll sees only the
  # next FUTURE occurrence.
  #
  # Awaiting review can't relaunch: a role that ran is `status: closed` until a
  # human tempers (accepts) it back to `active`, and `eligible?`'s status gate
  # excludes closed before this is ever reached. So this rule only governs an
  # already-armed role; it never resurrects one pending review.
