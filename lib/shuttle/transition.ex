defmodule Shuttle.Transition do
  @moduledoc """
  The unified write-plane for kanban transitions — one call that hides the
  resolve / invoke / owner-routing dance the kanban used to orchestrate itself.

  A kanban drag is `{fiber_id, target, origin}`: move this fiber to that column,
  and the fiber is owned by that host. `transition/3` turns it into a lifecycle
  mutation:

    1. **Route by origin.** The composite board (`GET /api/v1/fibers/composite`)
       stamps every fiber with the host that OWNS it. An `origin` that is this
       daemon (or absent / `"local"`) routes to the local branch; an `origin`
       matching a configured remote forwards over the tunnel; an unknown origin
       falls through to local, where the daemon's own ownership + availability
       gates are the final arbiter (mirroring Portolan's prior
       `resolveShuttleDaemonUrl` fallback).

    2. **Local branch** = resolve + invoke, in one process. `ActionQueries`
       reads the live felt document and tmux liveness outside the Poller
       mailbox to map `target` → a canonical action id; the same query path the
       availability gate reads, so the resolved action is in the availability
       set by construction (the `resolve ⊆ availability` invariant — see
       `gotcha-shuttle-resolve-invoke-daemon-split`). Then the invoke pipeline
       mutates: pause/reopen/close shell the offline frontmatter writer,
       accept-run / dispatch-ad-hoc go through the in-process lifecycle.

    3. **Forward branch** = `POST <remote>/api/v1/transition` with `origin`
       omitted, so the owning daemon runs its OWN local branch against its
       authoritative state. The owner-routing (route + forward) is
       `Shuttle.OriginRouter`, the one forwarder every write endpoint shares;
       this service only adds the resolve+invoke local branch and re-stamps the
       relayed response's `origin`. Terminating in one hop: a fiber has exactly
       one owner, and the owner never re-forwards.

  This service's `/transition` endpoint uses `invoke/2` and `http_error/1`, so the invoke pipeline and its
  status mapping have a single implementation.
