  Resolve a SINGLE fiber by its canonical id without dragging in the whole
  store. This is the per-fiber dual of `list/1`: Portolan resolves a remote
  fiber's content/owner (kanban card → vellum view) through this instead of
  fetching every fiber and linear-scanning, collapsing a ~3.5MB cross-tunnel
  transfer to one fiber.

  Two-tier lookup:

    * **Fast path** — `felt show <id> -j` per store. For a fiber physically
      rooted in the store the canonical id equals felt's traversal id, so the
      direct show resolves in milliseconds.
    * **Scan fallback** — for a symlink-traversed fiber (loom's `.felt/shapepipe`
      → a separate project store) the canonical id drops the store prefix, so
      `felt show <canonical-id>` misses. We then reuse the `list/1` machinery to
      enumerate the store and match on the canonical id. This costs a full
      `felt ls` daemon-side but still returns a single fiber over the wire, and
      only fires for the handful of symlinked-out projects.

  Returns the same `{:ok, %{host, felt_stores, fibers: […]}}` envelope as
  `list/1` with zero or one fiber, so Portolan reuses the same response parser.
  A missing fiber is `{:ok, …, fibers: []}` (not an error); a felt failure
  during the scan fallback surfaces as `{:error, errors}`.
