defmodule Shuttle.Kitty do
  @moduledoc """
  Open a worker's tmux session in a kitty tab on THIS machine.

  The standalone Shuttle UI is a browser app, so — unlike Portolan's native
  shell — it can't open a terminal itself. The daemon does it instead, via
  kitty's remote-control CLI (`kitty @ launch`). This is deliberately **not**
  owner-routed: the tab must appear where the human's browser is (the machine
  serving the UI), never on a headless cluster. A local-owned worker attaches
  directly; a remote-owned worker opens a *local* tab that `ssh -tt`es to the
  owning host and attaches there.

  Re-opening focuses the existing tab (matched by exact title) instead of
  spawning a duplicate — the same idempotent focus-then-launch Portolan's
  server uses. macOS in practice (kitty + `osascript` to raise the window);
  a host without kitty, or a kitty without remote control enabled, fails
  cleanly with `{:error, reason}` and the board surfaces a toast.

  Requires kitty's remote control to be reachable from outside a kitty window —
  i.e. `allow_remote_control yes` + a `listen_on unix:/tmp/kitty` in kitty.conf
  (or a `--listen-on` launch). The daemon isn't itself a kitty window, so it
  discovers the most-recently-touched `/tmp/kitty-*` socket (falling back to
  `$KITTY_LISTEN_ON` when the daemon *was* launched inside kitty).
