defmodule Shuttle.Poller do
  @moduledoc """
  Polls the felt fiber tree and dispatches workers for eligible constitutions.

  A single GenServer owns the dispatch tick, eligibility predicate, retry
  scheduling, and reconciliation. It starts `Shuttle.WorkerWatcher` processes
  under a `DynamicSupervisor` to track each worker's tmux session from outside.

  ## Multi-host support

  The Poller manages one or more felt stores on the same machine. Configure via:

      config :shuttle, felt_stores: ["~/loom", "~/other-project"]
      # or env var (comma-separated, takes precedence over the persisted file):
      LOOM_HOMES=~/loom,~/other-project
      # or persisted registration written through the HTTP API:
      ~/.shuttle/felt_stores.json

  Single-host setups (the common case) are unchanged: when no explicit hosts
  are configured, Shuttle falls back to `[LOOM_HOME || ~/loom]`.

  Each fiber resolves to exactly one host: the first configured host whose
  `.felt/` directory contains the fiber file. The resolution is cached in
  `State.fiber_host_cache` for the daemon's lifetime. Call
  `bust_fiber_host_cache/1` or `POST /api/v1/cache/bust` to evict an entry
  when a fiber moves between hosts.

  set-model) must call this immediately after the write so the UI's
  post-mutation refetch sees the new state instead of snapping back to stale

  cache a faithful mirror of disk for every field, with no per-verb drift. A

  #
  # ## Symlink discipline
  #
  # The same physical fiber file is often reachable from multiple felt hosts via
  # symlinks. Two cases that occur in practice:
  #
  # 1. A project host (`~/work/project-a`) whose `.felt/` is a symlink into
  #    `~/loom/.felt/work/project-a/`. The same `task-board.md` is reachable as
  #    `task-board` (project view) and `work/project-a/task-board` (loom view).
  #
  # 2. A project-canonical felt store (lightcone) whose own `.felt/` is a real
  #    directory, with loom symlinking *into* it at
  #    `~/loom/.felt/ai-futures/lightcone -> ~/lightcone/.felt`. The same fiber
  #    is reachable as `lightcone-ui/...` (lightcone view) and
  #    `ai-futures/lightcone/lightcone-ui/...` (loom view).
  #
  # If both views were enumerated, dispatch would race: each "different" id
  # passes `tmux has-session` independently → multiple workers on one file.
  #
  # **Rule: a fiber is enumerated only by the host where it is physically
  # rooted.** `list_shuttle_fibers/2` enforces this by reading felt's carried
  # `path` (absolute, symlink-resolved) and keeping a fiber iff that path lives
  # under `realpath(host)/.felt/` — so case 2's loom view drops the fiber (its
  # realpath roots in lightcone) and the lightcone store claims it. A store
  # whose own `.felt/` is a symlink (case 1) owns nothing; the target store
  # enumerates it. Ownership is read from felt's path, never reverse-derived.

  Resolves this daemon's `own_host_id` — the identity it advertises for the
  `shuttle.host` dispatch filter. Public so other callers (e.g.
  `ShuttleWeb.FiberController` when stamping a `host:` on a new fiber) share
  the exact same resolution.

  This is THE one host-identity resolver. Every surface that stamps or
  matches `shuttle.host` — the dispatch filter, the `/api/v1/fibers` owned
  feed, the CLI's `host:` stamp on new fibers, the state/reserve/snapshot
  endpoints — goes through here, so a daemon's advertised identity is
  single-valued by construction. Do not re-derive `:inet.gethostname()`
  anywhere else; that drift is exactly how candide came to own by `c03`
  (the raw hostname) while its fibers were stamped `candide` (the alias),
  and the owner-only feed silently dropped every one of them.

  Precedence:

    1. `SHUTTLE_HOST` env var, if set and non-empty. The explicit override
       and the test seam — `config/test.exs` pins it via `System.put_env/2`,
       and the daemon's tmux respawn loop can export it.

    2. `~/.shuttle/host` file (first non-empty line), if present. The durable
       per-host canonical identity: unlike the env var it survives every
       daemon launch path (`make start`, a bare `bin/shuttle start`, a
       respawn outside the loop), so the daemon *derives* its friendly name
       (`candide` instead of `c03`) rather than depending on an operator
       remembering to export it. Override the path with `SHUTTLE_HOST_FILE`.

    3. `:inet.gethostname()` — short OS hostname. Two separately-deployed
       daemons get distinct ids automatically; no per-machine config needed.

  No `Application.get_env(:shuttle, :host)` step and no `"local"` default:
  an absent `host:` is unowned everywhere, never silently grabbed.

  Raises if `:inet.gethostname/0` truly fails — a system-level problem;
  silently degrading into a no-op filter would make the failure invisible.

  # cyclical, just a oneshot-shaped looper): on exit-while-active it stays
  # `status: active` and re-dispatches next poll (the loop); a human stops the
  # loop by parking it (`active → open`). A pinned worker that's genuinely done
  # self-closes to `status: closed` — handled by the `status == "closed"` branch

  # dispatch/handoff markers, not in the status field.
