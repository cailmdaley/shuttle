defmodule Shuttle.StandingRole do
  @moduledoc """
  Parses and classifies `shuttle.kind: standing` fiber declarations.

  Standing roles are still felt fibers. Shuttle interprets the `shuttle:` block
  plus the document's `status`/`tempered` to decide whether a role is sleeping,
  due, or running. "Awaiting review" and "accepted/composted" are document facts
  (`status:closed` + untempered / `tempered`), not a `review.state` axis — there
  is none; the schedule-derived phase here only answers sleeping/due/running for
  an armed role.

  **felt is the cron authority; this module is the timing decider (Stage 4b).**
  The daemon no longer parses cron. felt resolves the schedule on every read and
  inlines two timestamps under `shuttle.resolved`: `next_due` (the next
  occurrence strictly after now — display) and `prev_due` (the most recent
  occurrence at or before now — the catch-up dispatch signal). This module reads
  those off the block and answers every timing question by comparing instants.
  The key reduction: "did a tick fire since the role was last serviced?" is
  `prev_due > last_serviced`, equal to the old `NextOccurrence(last_serviced) <=
  now` window check for every schedule with an occurrence inside felt's ~1-year
  catch-up horizon — i.e. every real standing role. The two diverge only for a
  sub-annual schedule on a role unserviced for >1 year (e.g. a leap-Feb-29 role
  between leap years): felt's `prev_due` scans 1 year back from now and omits it,
  so such a role sleeps until its next fire rather than firing an ancient
  catch-up — an accepted, arguably-better behavior at that exotic boundary.

  Occurrence-derived due check for the **dispatch** path: true iff the schedule's
  most recent tick (felt's `prev_due`) fell inside the lookback `(now -
  window_ms, now]` — equivalently, strictly after `window_start = now -
  window_ms`. felt's prev_due is always `<= felt's now <= now`, so the upper
  bound holds for free and only the lower bound is checked.

  Due-ness is a pure timestamp comparison against felt's resolved occurrence, NOT
  a cron parse and NOT a stored `next_due_at`. The *meaning* of the lookback is
  the caller's. The poller (`standing_role_due?`) anchors it at the role's last
  service (`now - last_serviced`), so this reduces to **`prev_due >
  last_serviced`**: "an occurrence elapsed since we last ran" — i.e. the schedule
  self-catches a fire the daemon slept through, however late, rather than
  skipping it.

  A single catch-up fires, not a backlog: once a role fires its document flips
  `active -> closed`, `eligible?` excludes closed, and the run advances the
  anchor to ~now — so the `active -> closed -> accept` transition is the
  per-cycle gate, not a timestamp, and an awaiting role never re-fires until a
  human tempers it.

  It does NOT consult `review.state` — the dispatch gate is the felt document's
  `status`/`tempered` (the poller checks those before calling this).
