  Dispatches a worker for the given fiber ID.

  Returns `{:ok, tmux_session_name}` on success, or an error tuple.

  Options:
    * `:runner` — module implementing `Shuttle.Runner` behavior for test injection.
      Defaults to `Shuttle.Runner.Default`.
    * `:work_dir` — working directory for the tmux session. Defaults to `File.cwd!()`.
    * `:felt_store` — directory containing the `.felt/` index this dispatch
      should read fibers from. Defaults to `default_felt_store/0`.
      The Poller passes its configured `state.felt_store` here so each shuttle
      instance is consistent within itself; running multiple shuttle instances
      against different felt stores (e.g. one for `~/loom`, another for a
      standalone project root) is the supported way to span felt stores.
    * `:prompt_context` — `:constitution` (default) or `:standing_run`.
    * `:force_fresh` — when true, ignore any prior resume intent and start a
      new session. Used for autonomous continuation loops; explicit
      human-triggered "Resume previous" remains the only path that reuses a
      transcript.
    * `:force` — explicit manual dispatch override. When true, the dispatcher
      stops refusing closed fibers (the Poller already relaxes eligibility
      under force) and `resolve_resume_intent` ignores the ad-hoc
      short-circuit so the caller's `resume_mode` is honored regardless of
      dispatch context.
    * `:resume_mode` — the user's continuation directive, a transient dispatch
      parameter carried with the dispatch call: `"previous"` resumes the
      dispatch marker's session, `"fresh"` always starts new (unconditional —
      wins over the marker heuristic), absent → marker-decided.
    * `:user_message` — the user's free-text directive for this dispatch,
      inlined into the prompt at launch (the "From User" block). Transient: it
      rides the dispatch call, never a persisted felt event.

  Decides whether this dispatch should resume a prior worker session or start

    the worker in a transcript whose last assistant turn was "Run accepted.
    Exiting" — they'd idle ("nothing new on the fiber") instead of doing the

    `resume_mode` dispatch parameter (`"previous"` / `"fresh"`), falling back
    to the continuation heuristic (read off the fiber's `shuttle:` block) when no

  Renders the universal dispatch prompt for a fiber ID.

  The prompt opens with a single orientation paragraph — what Shuttle is,
  what the worker is here to do, and how the practice gets loaded — then
  inlines exactly one context block:

    - **From User** — the user's message for this dispatch, if any.
      Carried as a transient dispatch parameter (`:user_message`),
      inlined here and discarded — never persisted.

  We deliberately *don't* inline the fiber's outcome or the last
  handoff prose. Both are already in scope after the worker calls
  `felt show <fiber-id>` (which renders outcome and the body, including
  the `## Status` handoff block the previous session rewrote). The
  shuttle skill prescribes that read order; duplicating either here just
  bloats the prompt and risks drift between the inlined snapshot and
  felt's own view.

  Why keep the From User block inlined? The user's directive arrives
  *with* the dispatch — it isn't in the constitution the worker reads on
  arrival, and having it sit at the top of the prompt where causal
  attention sees it first conditions the worker's reading of everything
  that follows.

  The exit contract appears directly in the prompt, even though the full
  practice lives in the `shuttle` skill. Resumed sessions otherwise arrive
  with a lighter prompt and can mistake Shuttle work for ordinary chat
  completion; keeping `kill $PPID` in the causal foreground preserves the
  dispatcher contract across fresh and resumed runs.

  On felt failure (binary missing, no history yet) the From User block
  falls back to empty — dispatch continues rather than failing, and
  the worker just gets the orientation header.

After you update outcome, file findings, and commit at a clean checkpoint, rewrite the constitution's `## Status` section in prose — where the work stands, what's blocked, where the next session picks up (rewritten, never a session log) — then your FINAL action is `felt shuttle handoff <fiber-id>`, which writes the clean-exit marker and ends your session (no separate `kill $PPID` needed). The handoff marker is load-bearing: it tells the daemon you closed cleanly, so the next dispatch starts fresh and reads your `## Status` note. WITHOUT it, a session that simply died (the process was killed mid-thought — common on remote machines) is indistinguishable from a clean exit, so the daemon RESUMES your transcript instead of looping a fresh, context-less worker. Exception: if the dispatch directive or constitution explicitly asks you to wait for a human (a 2FA gate, a send-in-his-voice step, a \"talk to me first\" signal), drive to that checkpoint and stay alive there instead — do not hand off. Do not substitute a normal chat final response for worker exit; the handoff belongs in the fiber."

  # ── Capture (spawn-without-constitution) ──

  @doc """
  Spawns a tmux agent session from a free-text capture prompt — no
  pre-existing fiber required.

  The chat-to-card intake: the user's yap is carried verbatim into the
  spawned session's prompt, together with the felt store and instructions to
  crystallize the idea into a fiber, install a `shuttle:` block, claim the
  session via `POST /api/v1/claim`, and then continue as the worker realizing
  the new constitution. The session name (`capture-<hex>`) deliberately does
  NOT end in `-shuttle`: the daemon's orphan/adoption machinery ignores it
  until the worker claims it, at which point the claim verb renames the tmux
  session to the canonical `<leaf>-<uid>-shuttle` form — from then on it is
  indistinguishable from a dispatched worker.

  Options:
    * `:runner` — `Shuttle.Runner` impl (default `Shuttle.Runner.Default`)
    * `:work_dir` — project directory to spawn in (required)
    * `:felt_store` — felt store the worker should file into
    * `:agent` — agent registry name (default `"claude-sonnet"`, the bare
      fallback; fable is disabled and is never a default)
    * `:effort` — reasoning-effort token, validated against the agent's
      `effort_levels` (same contract as `shuttle.effort` on a fiber)
    * `:chrome` — boolean; claude harness only (same as `shuttle.chrome`)
    * `:port` — daemon HTTP port for the claim callback
    * `:host` — owning host id to stamp into the shuttle block (optional)

  Returns `{:ok, %{session:, session_uuid:, agent_id:}}` or `{:error, reason}`.

    Shuttle capture session. The user had an idea and spoke it into the board's capture box; you are the session it spawned. Your job: crystallize the idea into a fiber, claim this session as its worker, then realize it. The `felt` and `shuttle` skills carry the practice — activate them first.

    Felt store: #{felt_store}
    Project dir: #{project_dir}

    Steps, in order (the order is load-bearing — claim BEFORE activating, or the poll loop dispatches a duplicate worker in the gap):
    1. **Crystallize.** Read the idea below and file it as a fiber in the felt store, nested under the right parent (felt-skill judgment — search for kin first). Write the lede and a `## Desired State` the idea has earned; don't over-spec a sketch.
    2. **Install the shuttle block.** Add to the fiber's frontmatter: `shuttle:` with `kind: oneshot`, `agent: #{agent_id}`#{axes_yaml}, `project_dir: #{project_dir}`. #{host_line}Leave felt `status` as `open` for now.
    3. **Claim this session** (registers you with the daemon as the fiber's worker — exit handling, liveness, and the kanban all flow from this):

       curl -s -X POST http://localhost:#{port}/api/v1/claim -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"fiber_id": "<the fiber id you created>", "tmux_session": "#{session}"#{uuid_field}, "agent": "#{agent_id}"}'

       A successful claim renames this tmux session to the fiber's canonical worker name — that is expected. The claim is idempotent: if the response is lost, retry with the same body.
    4. **Activate.** Now set felt `status: active`. (Doing this before the claim would make the fiber dispatch-eligible while the daemon cannot yet see this session — a duplicate worker would spawn.)
    5. **Realize.** From here you are an ordinary Shuttle worker on that fiber: drive toward the Desired State, keep outcome/history current, and exit per the contract below.
