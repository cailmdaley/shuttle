  Expand a store list with the project roots of any **symlinked substores**
  reachable from each store's `.felt/`.

  A project-canonical substore — candide's
  `~/loom/.felt/science/unions/shapepipe -> .../code/shapepipe/.felt` — is
  physically rooted *outside* the store it is linked into. The poller enumerates
  a fiber only from the store where its felt `path` physically roots
  (`run_shuttle_listing/2`'s `store_felt_realpath` prefix check), so the loom
  store correctly drops those fibers — and they vanish from the kanban unless the
  project root is *also* a configured store. Following the symlink here makes
  configuring just `~/loom` sufficient: the project root is auto-discovered, no
  per-substore config.

  For each store, scan `<store>/.felt/` **recursively** for symlinks resolving to
  an external real `.felt/` directory and add its parent (the project root). The
  scan must recurse, not just read the top level: candide mounts substores deep in
  the tree mirror (`science/unions/shapepipe`), so a shallow scan finds nothing and
  the substore silently vanishes from dispatch. Dedup is by
  `store_felt_realpath/1` — the same canonicalization the ownership check uses —
  so a store reached two ways (configured explicitly *and* discovered, or via two
  path spellings of the same real dir) is listed once. That dedup is load-bearing:
  two stores with the same `.felt` realpath would enumerate the same fibers and
  reintroduce the dispatch race the physical-rooting rule exists to prevent.
  Dangling symlinks and links resolving back inside the linking store are skipped.

  Resolve a public fiber identifier to the felt address Shuttle can shell out to.

  Resolution asks felt for the answer — it never reconstructs the path from the

  topology) `felt show -j <addr>` resolves the fiber and carries its physical
  `path`, addressable `id`, and intrinsic `uid` directly. For a bare intrinsic
  ULID — which `felt show` cannot address — we scan each store's `felt ls -j`
  for the matching `uid` and read the carried `path` from that row. Either way
  the values come from felt's read chokepoint, not from guessing filesystem
  layouts.

  Returns `%{host, fiber_id, path, uid}` where `host` is the owning store root
  (for shelling subsequent felt commands), `fiber_id` is felt's addressable
  slug, `path` is the absolute on-disk file, and `uid` is the intrinsic identity
