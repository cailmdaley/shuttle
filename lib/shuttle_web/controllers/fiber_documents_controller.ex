  Agent-API endpoint for daemon-local fiber document reads.

  `GET /api/v1/fibers` returns the fibers visible to this daemon's configured
  felt stores. `GET /api/v1/fibers/:id` resolves a SINGLE fiber by canonical id
  — the per-fiber lookup used to open a card without fetching every fiber — and
  is OWNER-ROUTED: a remote-owned fiber's body is fetched from the owning daemon
  over the SSH tunnel (see `show/2`), never assumed present in a local git
  mirror. The `fiber` payload is felt JSON, intentionally leaving document
  parsing semantics with felt and the reader.

  Query params (both actions):
    * `body=true`    — include each fiber's markdown body.

  `GET /api/v1/fibers` only:
    * `shuttle=true` — the owner-only kanban feed: return ONLY the fibers THIS
      daemon owns — a `shuttle:` block AND `shuttle.host == own_host_id`. A
      viewer reads this endpoint as a REMOTE origin and concatenates each
      owner's answer (never merges, because no fiber is authoritatively present
      on two hosts); a fiber pinned to another host belongs to that host's feed,
      never this one's git mirror. Also narrows the cross-tunnel transfer to the
      few hundred owned shuttle fibers. Omitted/unknown => unfiltered (every
      fiber, unowned included) — the content/search/graph readers, not the
      kanban feed.

  `GET /api/v1/fibers/:id` — resolve one fiber by canonical id. The id is a
  wildcard splat so nested ids (`ai-futures/portolan/foo`) arrive as path
  segments; rejoin with `/`. Returns the same envelope shape as `index/2` with
  zero or one fiber, so Portolan reuses the list-response parser. A missing
  fiber is a 200 with `fibers: []`, not a 404 — the caller treats an empty list
  as "not here", same as scanning the full list would.

  **Owner-routed via `Shuttle.OriginRouter`, exactly like `/file`.** Only the
  daemon that owns a fiber's host can read its body off that host's filesystem.
  The composite board stamps each fiber with its `origin`; the detail panel
  carries that origin back here. A local-owned fiber is read here; a remote-owned
  fiber forwards to the owning daemon's identical `/api/v1/fibers/:id` (origin
  stripped) over the SSH tunnel and relays the JSON verbatim. This is the ONLY
  correct source for a remote constitution's body — git-mirror replication is
  incidental and must never be relied on for availability.

  `GET /api/v1/fibers/composite` — the unified cross-host kanban board.

  Concatenates this daemon's local owner feed (from the poller's document cache,
  which stamps local tmux liveness) with each remote daemon's cached owner feed
  (`Shuttle.RemoteFiberRegistry`, which stamps the remote's own liveness at the
  remote's serve time). The result is a flat per-fiber list where every fiber's
  liveness was resolved by its OWNING host — one observer per fiber, no
  cross-observer disagreement, so the kanban can classify directly without a
  second tmux read.

  Each fiber row carries an `origin` field (the owning host/remote name) so the
  view can route worker-badge focus and transitions without re-deriving owner
  from the `shuttle.host` block. `origins` reports per-origin staleness so the
  view can mark an unreachable remote without dropping its last-known cards.

  This is the local-composer counterpart of `/state/composite`: the kanban talks
  to ONE (local) Shuttle and sees local + every configured remote.
